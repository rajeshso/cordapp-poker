# CorDapp Poker - Texas-Hold-Em

Welcome to the Texas-Hold-Em-Process in CordaApp. 

# Pre-Requisites

See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html

See https://www.seilevel.com/requirements/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Texas-Hold-Em-Process-Flow.png

# Usage

## Running tests inside IntelliJ

We recommend editing your IntelliJ preferences so that you use the Gradle runner - this means that the quasar utils
plugin will make sure that some flags (like ``-javaagent`` - see below) are
set for you.

To switch to using the Gradle runner:

* Navigate to ``Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner`` (or search for `runner`)
  * Windows: this is in "Settings"
  * MacOS: this is in "Preferences"
* Set "Delegate IDE build/run actions to gradle" to true
* Set "Run test using:" to "Gradle Test Runner"

If you would prefer to use the built in IntelliJ JUnit test runner, you can run ``gradlew installQuasar`` which will
copy your quasar JAR file to the lib directory. You will then need to specify ``-javaagent:lib/quasar.jar``
and set the run directory to the project root directory for each test.

## Running the nodes

See https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html#running-the-example-cordapp.

## Interacting with the nodes

### Shell

When started via the command line, each node will display an interactive shell:

    Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
    Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.
    
    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>>

You can use this shell to interact with your node. For example, enter `run networkMapSnapshot` to see a list of 
the other nodes on the network:

    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>> run networkMapSnapshot
    [
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10002" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=Notary, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505484825
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10005" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PlayerA, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505382560
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10008" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PlayerB, L=New York, C=US" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505384742
    },
      {
       "addresses" : [ "localhost:10009" ],
       "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=Dealer, L=New York, C=US" ],
       "platformVersion" : 3,
       "serial" : 1541505384743
      }
    ]
    
    Tue Nov 06 12:30:11 GMT 2018>>> 

You can find out more about the node shell [here](https://docs.corda.net/shell.html).

### Client

`clients/src/main/kotlin/com/poker/Client.kt` defines a simple command-line client that connects to a node via RPC 
and prints a list of the other nodes on the network.

#### Running the client

##### Via the command line

Run the `runPokerClient` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Poker Client` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`.

### Webserver

`clients/src/main/kotlin/com/poker/webserver/` defines a simple Spring webserver that connects to a node via RPC and 
allows you to interact with the node over HTTP.

The API endpoints are defined here:

     clients/src/main/kotlin/com/poker/webserver/Controller.kt

And a static webpage is defined here:

     clients/src/main/resources/static/

#### Running the webserver

##### Via the command line

Run the `runPokerServer` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Poker Server` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

#### Interacting with the webserver

The static webpage is served on:

    http://localhost:10050

While the sole poker endpoint is served on:

    http://localhost:10050/pokerendpoint
